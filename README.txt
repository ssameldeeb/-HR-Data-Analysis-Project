üìä HR Data Analysis Project
üìå Introduction
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of HR data from a mid-sized company, consisting of 1,471 records related to employees' performance and personal/work-related attributes. The dataset includes key variables such as employee performance, overtime hours, gender, education level, and department (Sales, Marketing, Social Media, and Management).

Understanding these dimensions allows us to uncover patterns and trends that drive performance, identify inefficiencies, and recommend strategic improvements for better talent management. This project aims to turn raw HR data into actionable insights that contribute to smarter decision-making in workforce planning and performance optimization.

Department (Sales, Marketing, Social Media, Management)

Age, Monthly Income, Years at Company, etc.

üîç Key Insights
Overtime and Performance:

Employees who consistently worked overtime tended to have higher performance ratings, particularly in Sales and Social Media departments.

However, in Management, excessive overtime showed no significant performance gains ‚Äî suggesting diminishing returns or burnout.

Gender and Overtime:

Male employees were more likely to work overtime across all departments.

However, female employees in Marketing who worked overtime showed disproportionately higher performance compared to peers.

Education Level:

Employees with Bachelor‚Äôs degrees showed the highest performance, especially in Sales and Management.

Surprisingly, Master‚Äôs degree holders did not outperform Bachelor-level staff on average.

Departmental Breakdown:

Sales had the largest number of high performers, but also the highest turnover risk (due to workload).

Social Media teams had moderate performance with very high overtime participation.

‚úÖ Recommendations
Optimize Overtime Policies:

Encourage targeted overtime in high-yield departments (Sales, Social Media).

Avoid blanket overtime in Management where it doesn‚Äôt translate to results.

Gender Equity Initiatives:

Address overtime imbalances and explore flexible work arrangements for underrepresented genders.

Talent Development by Education Level:

Invest in ongoing training for Bachelor's degree holders to maintain high performance.

Explore reasons why higher education isn‚Äôt consistently leading to higher output ‚Äî possibly job-role mismatch.

Department-Specific Actions:

Sales: Balance performance with well-being; consider incentive schemes with wellness support.

Marketing: Leverage high-performing female employees in leadership tracks.

Social Media: Examine workload distribution to reduce burnout risk.

Management: Reassess KPIs and task distribution to match actual performance drivers.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
Microsoft Excel:
Data cleaning, preliminary analysis, pivot tables.

Microsoft Power BI:
Interactive dashboards, data visualization, advanced filtering, performance mapping.

üì£ Final Notes
This analysis helps uncover how overtime, education, gender, and department type interact with employee performance. These insights can be used by HR professionals and management teams to implement data-informed policies, build high-performing teams, and promote equity in the workplace.
